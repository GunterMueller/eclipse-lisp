Eclipse Common Lisp
===================

Eclipse Common Lisp is an ANSI Common Lisp written by Howard Stearns
while at Elwood Corp.

(This system is unrelated to the eclipse Java IDE)

It hasn't been touched in more than 10 years.  We are currently in the
process of updating it.  Unless you want to get involved in this
process, we recommend that you leave it alone until we are done.

Ultimately, Eclipse Common Lisp will be portable to 32 & 64 bit Linux,
Mac, and Windows.
