Eclipse Common Lisp
===================

Eclipse Common Lisp is an ANSI Common Lisp written by Howard Stearns
while at Elwood Corp.

(This system is unrelated to the eclipse Java IDE)

Eclipse Common Lisp is a Lisp interpreter written in C and Lisp.  It
is also capable of compiling Lisp to C and linking it into the eclipse
system.

It hasn't been touched in more than 10 years.  We are currently in the
process of updating it.  Unless you want to get involved in this
process, we recommend that you leave it alone until we are done.

This system depends upon the existence of the Boehm-Demers-Weiser
conservative garbage collector which is located at:

Ultimately, Eclipse Common Lisp will be portable to 32 & 64 bit Linux,
Mac, and Windows.
