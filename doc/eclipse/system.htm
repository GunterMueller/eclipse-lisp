<H2>Eclipse C: Initializing the Eclipse Library</H2>
<hr>

The following functions are among those defined in the Eclipse libraries:

<UL>
<LI> <a href="initf.htm"><b>clInit</b></a> -- Initializes all data
used by the Eclipse run time library.

<LI> <a href="initdf.htm"><b>clInitD</b></a> -- Initializes all data
used by the Eclipse development library.  <b>clInit</b> must be called
before clInitD is called.

</UL>

The functions above initialize the data used by various utilities in the
Eclipse library.  This includes:

<UL>
<LI> The interning of symbols.

<LI> The creation of compile-file literal data (i.e. any Lisp data
used by the library).

<LI> Assignment of symbol properties, such as
<b>symbol-function</b> for symbols naming functions, or
<b>symbol-value</b> for symbols naming special variables.
</UL>

The sources for these functions are provided.  

<p>Later releases may break these down into finer grained pieces, but
the two functions above will always be available.

<p>See also, <a href="lib.htm">"The Eclipse Libraries"</a>.

<!--
<blockquote><i>

In later versions, finer grain control over system initialization will
be provided.  Specifically, it will be possible to avoid initializing
the <b>symbol-value</b> of all the Common Lisp symbols, as this would
make a <a href="gloss.htm#stand"><i>stand-alone</i></a> executable
reference all the functions in the library.  

<P>
It will also be possible to avoid referencing <b>format</b> (and the
implied potential call to <b>eval</b>) by using a library
initialization function that initializes <b>format</b> with a
definition that essentially prints only the format-control string as
literal string, with no format-directive substitution.

<P>
It will also be possible to avoid referencing <b>read</b>,
<b>eval</b>, and <b>print</b> by using a library initialization
function that uses a special version of <b>invoke-debugger</b> which only
prints an error message (using the limited <b>format</b>) and exits.

<p>
Some system defined load-forms for compile-file literals
involves function calls that could instead be defined to use C macros
that did more of the work at C compile/link time.
