<H2>Eclipse Introduction: Installation</H2>

<OL>
<LI> The distribution can be used directly from the CD on which it is
distributed, or copied to a hard disk.  

<p>
The CD distribution contains a single directory which has a name
reflecting the Eclipse version number (eg. <code>eclipse-1.0.1</code>).
All the other subdirectories (<code>doc</code>, <code>bin</code>,
<code>c</code>) are under this directory.  If desired you can copy
only selected protions of this subdirectory to your hard disk.

<p>
Within this single, versioned, directory are the following subdirectories and
files:

<ul>

<p><li>
  <b>bin</b> - contains executables and libraries for various
  platforms.  These directories also contain a copy of <code>eclipse.h</code>. 

<p><li>
  <b>c</b> - contains C source code including:
   <ul>
     <li><b>eclipse.h</b> - the header file that must be included in any C
     code that uses the Eclipse library.
     <li><b>eclipse.c</b> - the <a href="main.htm"><code>main()</code></a> for
     the top-level Lisp listener program.
     <li><b>interface.c</b> - platform specific utilities used to
     implement Eclipse, and the initialization code for the Eclipse
     run time library.
     <li><b>initd.c</b> - initialization code for the Eclipse dynamic
     library. 
     <li><b>gc</b> - a directory containg the source code for automatic
     memory management.
   </ul>

<p><li>
  <b>doc</b>
   <ul>
      <li><b>alu</b>
      <ul>
          <li><b>index.htm</b> - a mirror of the Association of Lisp Users' website.
      </ul>
      <li><b>eclipse</b>
      <ul>
          <li><b>index.htm</b> - the start of the Eclipse documentation.
      </ul>
   </ul>
</ul>

<p>
Thus the minimal installation would include only the subdirectory of
<b>bin</b> appropriate to your platform, and perhaps
<b>doc/eclipse</b>.

<P>
In any case, we will refer to this versioned directory where files are
ultimately placed as <CODE><em>eclipse-directory</em></CODE>.

<p>
We suggest making a single directory on your hard disk which will keep
all versions of Eclipse.  For example, if you make a directory
<code>/usr/elwood</code>, then for each new version,
<code><em>eclipse-directory</em></code> will be
<code>/usr/elwood/eclipse-1.0</code>,
<code>/usr/elwood/eclipse-1.1</code>, etc.

<ul>
<p>
<li>When using a GUI-style "File Manger", "Finder", "File Explorer",
etc., you can use the usual windowing gestures to copy files.  Make
sure that you copy subdirectories as well as the top level
directories.

<p>
<li>
The following
<code>unix</code> commands will copy the entire contents of the CD to
a selected location on a hard disk:
<pre>
   mkdir <i>directory-on-hard-disk</i>
   cd <i>directory-on-which-cd-is-mounted</i>
   find . -depth -print | cpio -pd <i>directory-on-hard-disk</i>
</pre>
For example, if you have a <code>/usr/elwood</code> directory for all
versions of Eclipse <code><em>directory-on-hard-disk</em></code>,
above, is <code>/usr/elwood</code>.  The commands above will create
the versioned <CODE><em>eclipse-directory</em></CODE> for you.

</ul>

<P>For additional instructions on
creating and initializing this directory, see the <a
HREF="UNPACKING">&quot;doc/eclipse/UNPACKING&quot;</a> file which was included
in the distribution.

<P>
<LI> Read <A HREF="org.htm">&quot;Organization of Eclipse&quot;</A>.

<p>
<li> Any "quality of life" links from standard, non-eclipse
directories to <b>previous</b> eclipse releases should be removed.
Each Eclipse release contains a <code>make clean-auxiliary</code>
command that does this.  For example, as root, change to the binary
directory of the previous release (eg. <code>bin/sparc</code>,
<code>bin/hppa</code>, etc.) and type <code>make
clean-auxiliary</code>.  If you do not have a standard
<code>make</code> command for your operating system, you will have to
clean up after any previous Eclipse releases by hand.

<P>
<LI> The <a href="gloss.htm#eclipse"><CODE>eclipse</CODE></a> program
is a stand-alone, ready to run program, and is located in
<CODE><em>eclipse-directory</em>/bin/<em>platform</em></CODE>.  Here
<code><em>platform</em></code> is one of <code>windows</code>,
<code>sparc</code>,
<code>hppa</code>, etc.  You can run the executable as you would any other program.
However there are some &quot;quality of life&quot; things you might
want to do:
<P>

<OL>

<LI> Make sure the <CODE>eclipse</CODE> executable is in your
<CODE>$PATH</CODE>.  There are two ways to do this:
 <UL> 
 <LI> Edit your <CODE>.cshrc</CODE>, <CODE>.login</CODE>, or
 <CODE>.profile</CODE>, as appropriate, to include the directory
 <CODE><em>eclipse-directory</em>/bin/<em>platform</em></CODE> in your <CODE>$PATH</CODE>
 environment variable.

 <LI> Link
 <CODE><em>eclipse-directory</em>/bin/<em>platform</em>/eclipse</CODE>
 to some place which is already on your path.  For example, on Unix
 systems, if <CODE>/usr/local/bin</CODE> is on your path and you have
 write permission there, use:
 <PRE>
 ln -s <em>eclipse-directory</em>/bin/<em>platform</em>/eclipse /usr/local/bin
 </PRE>
 </UL> <p> The file
 <code><em>eclipse-directory</em>/bin/<em>platform</em>/makefile</code>
 contains a <code>setup</code> command that will create the above
 link, as well as those described below.
 Thus, as root, one can do:
 <pre>
 cd <em>eclipse-directory</em>/bin/<em>platform</em>; make setup
 </pre>

<LI> Set up an <CODE>init.lisp</CODE> file.  See the <A
HREF="init.htm">&quot;<code>init.lisp</code>&quot;</A> chapter.

<LI> Set up an <CODE>ECLIPSEHOME</CODE> environment variable (for
example, by editing your <CODE>.cshrc</CODE> or <CODE>.profile</CODE>
file.)  <CODE>ECLIPSEHOME</CODE> is only used to provide a default
root for the <CODE>&quot;SYS&quot;</CODE> logical pathname host.  See
<A HREF="site.htm">&quot;Site and Other Initial
Definitions&quot;</A>.

</OL>

<P>
<LI> If you will use the library from C, you will need to have access
to the <a href="lib.htm">library</a> and the <a
href="impl.htm">header</a> (i.e. include) files.  These are located in
<CODE><em>eclipse-directory</em>/bin/<em>platform</em></CODE>.  

<P>
You can either:
<P>
 <UL>
 <LI> Instruct your linker to find these files by passing additional
 arguments each time you use them.  For example:
 <PRE>
  cc -I<em>eclipse-directory</em>/bin/<em>platform</em>
     -L<em>eclipse-directory</em>/bin/<em>platform</em>
     <em>&lt;other options and filenames&gt;</em>
     -leclipse
  </PRE>
  The exact options accepted by your compiler may vary.

 <LI> Link the files to some place which is already on the library
 path and include-file path used by your compiler.
 </UL> 

 <p> The file <code><em>eclipse-directory</em>/bin/<em>plaform</em>/makefile</code>
 contains a <code>setup</code> command that will create <em>all</em> the above
 links.  Thus one can do:
 <pre>
 cd <em>eclipse-directory</em>/bin/<em>platform</em>; make setup
 </pre>

<strong>N.B.</strong>: See <a href="lib.htm">&quot;The Eclipse
Library&quot;</a> to see how the library is set up in your
implementation.
