<h2>What's New for Eclipse Common Lisp  Release 1.0.2</h2>

<h4>December 5, 1997</h4>

<ul>
<li> <a href="new-1.0.1.htm">1.0.1</a> (Solaris 2,  Unix System V)
<li> <a href="new-1.0.htm">1.0</a> (SunOS 4.1, Berkeley Unix)
</ul>


<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
<li> Ported to <b>HP PA-RISC/HP-UX</b>. (First non-Sun Eclipse platform.)
<li> Separate binary directories for each platform, with links to
master C source directory. 
<li> A single macro in <code>eclipse.h</code> defines the Eclipse
version as a C string.

<li> Version 1.0.1 licence holders can upgrade to 1.0.2 by downloading
<a
href="ftp://www.elwood.com/eclipse/patch-1.0.1.tgz">ftp://www.elwood.com/eclipse/patch-1.0.1.tgz</a>
to the general (i.e. non-versioned) directory in which eclipse is
installed, and following the directions in <a
HREF="UNPACKING">&quot;UNPACKING&quot;</a>
for downloaded file distributions.  The libraries and executable can
then be regenerated following the directions for <a
href="release.htm#recompilation"><b>recompilation</b></a> in the <a
href="release.htm">release notes</a>.
</ul>

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li> Reading (or loading) files with <b>:external-format
:multi-byte</b> (which is the default) now works with files
containg more than 512 bytes.
<li><b>Read</b> can now properly handle a list containing a
<b>float</b> which begins with a decimal (eg. .5 as opposed to 0.5).
<li> 29 bit <b>fixnums</b> now function properly.
<li> <b>Truncate</b> and <b>ftruncate</b> rounds in the correct direction.
<li> <b>Compiled-function-p</b> works correctly. 
<li><b>Load-time-value</b> in interpreted code now returns a
single value, just as in compiled code.
<li> Local variables named with uninterned symbols are prefixed with
"L" when compiled to C, not "CL".
<li> Formatting error in <b>time</b> macro is fixed.

<li> <a name="patch">A patch is available that provides the following additional
bug fixes:</a>
<ul>

<li> <b>Apply</b> checks that <b>call-arguments-limit</b> is not
exceeded. (Note the <a href="new-1.0.3.htm#big-pretty">special pretty
printer</a> bug, in the new features for <a
href="new-1.0.3.htm">release 1.0.3</a>.)

<li> The scanning of directories no longer involves the Posix
<code>opendir()</code> utility, which can interfere with the garbage
collector.

<li> <b>Dribble</b> is now correct.

<li> <b>Trace</b> now correctly prints the traced function name.

<li> The variable <b>eclipse::not-found</b> is now proclaimed
special.  This variable appears within macro
generated code for <b>with-package-iterator</b>, <b>do-symbols</b>,
etc, where it is assumed to be special.

<li> The first use of <b>time</b> no longer reports a negative real
time, and the value reported on the HP is no longer off by a constant
factor.

<li> Uninterned symbols appearing as literals in a file being compiled
now generate references to properly initialized, <code>static
clObject</code>s, instead of references to undefined <code>extern
clObject</code>s.  Uninterned symbols appear as literals in some
macroexpansions, such as the expansion of a <b>defstruct</b> which
uses the <b>:print-function</b> option.

<li>Echo streams don't try to echo <code>NIL</code> to the output
stream when <b>read-char-no-hang</b> is called and no character is
available.

</ul>

Eclipse 1.0.2 users can upgrade to 1.0.2A by downloading <a

HREF="UNPACKING">&quot;UNPACKING&quot;</a> for downloaded file
distributions.  The libraries and executable can then be regenerated
following the directions for <a
