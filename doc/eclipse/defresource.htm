<B>Description:</B>

<P>
<b>Defresource</b> defines a resource named <i>name</i>.
<i>Parameters</i> is a lambda-list giving names and default values (for
optional and keyword parameters) of parameters to an object of this
type.

<P>
<i>Constructor</i> is an expression that is responsible for creating an
object, and is called when someone tries to allocate an object from
the resource and no suitable free objects exist.  The constructor form
can access the parameters as variables.

<P>
<i>Initializer</i> is an expression that is used to initialize an
object gotten from the resource.  It can access the parameters as
variables, and also has access to a variable called <i>name</i>, which
is the object to be initialized.  The initializer is called both on
newly created objects and objects that are being reused.

<P>
<i>Deinitializer</i> is an expression that is used to deinitialize an
object when it is about to be returned to the resource.  It can access
the parameters as variables, and also has access to a variable called
<i>name</i>, which is the object to be deinitialized.  It is called
whenever an object is deallocated back to the resource, but is not
called by <a href="clear-resource.htm"><b>clear-resource</b></a>.
Deinitializers are typically used to clear references to other
objects.

<P>
<i>Matcher</i> is an expression that ensures that an object in the
resource "matches" the specified parameters, which it can access as
variables.  In addition, the matcher  also has access to a variable
called <i>name</i>, which is the object in the resource being matched
against.  If no matcher is supplied, the system remembers the value for
the parameters (including optional ones that defaulted) that were used
to construct the object, and assumes that it matches those particular
values for all time.  This comparison is done with equal.  The matcher
should return <em>true</em> if there is a match, otherwise it should
return <em>false</em>.

<P>
<i>Initial-copies</i> is used to specify the number of objects that
should be initially put into the resource.  <code>NIL</code> is
equivalent to 0.  If initial copes are made and there are parameters,
all the parameters must be optional; in this case, the initial copies
have the default values of the parameters.<P>

<B>Side Effects:</B> Redefines any existing resource of the same <i>name</i>.<P> 

<B>Affected By:</B> None.<P>

<B>Exceptional Situations:</B> None.<P>

<B>Notes:</B> 

<P> After redefining a resource, it may be necessary to recompile any
previously compiled references to that resource, whether the reference
is through the <em>macro</em> <a
href="using-resource.htm"><b>using-resource</b></a>, or a
<em>function</em> such as <a
href="allocate-resource.htm"><b>allocate-resource</b></a>.
