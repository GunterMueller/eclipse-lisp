<H2>Eclipse Applications: Overview of Delivering Applications</H2>
<hr>

<a href="c.htm">"Using Eclipse Utilities From C"</a> explains how
every Common Lisp utility is available to C programmers through a
<a href="lib.htm">C linkable library</a>.  It also explains:
 <ul>
 <li> the <a href="names.htm">naming convention</a> by which Lisp utilities may be referenced
 in C.
 <li> the <a href="system.htm">initializations</a> that must be performed at run-time before Lisp utilities may
 be used.
 </ul>

<p>
To deliver an Eclipse application that has some source written in
Common Lisp, one may use the function <a
href="compile.htm"><b>compile-file</b></a> to convert a Lisp source file to
a C source file.  The resulting C source file uses the same
conventions as the Eclipse library and may be treated as though it
were hand written C code that uses the library.

<p>
In standard C, each <a href="gloss.htm#stand">stand-alone application
(1)</a> must define a function named <b><code>main</code></b> which is
automatically called by the operating system when the application
starts up.  The <b><code>main</code></b> function of an Eclipse
application must be supplied by the programmer.  Typically, it calls
the Eclipse library <a href="gloss.htm#sys-init">system initialization
functions</a>, the <a href="gloss.htm#init">initialization
functions</a> for generated C code, and finally calls a C function
defined in one of the generated C files that defines the top level
operations of the application.

<p>
The C source code of the <b><code>main</code></b> function for the <a
href="gloss.htm#eclipse"><i>eclipse (1)</i></a> <a
href="gloss.htm#top-level">top-level (2)</a> executable program is
<a href="main.htm">provided as an example</a>.
