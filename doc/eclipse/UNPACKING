UNPACKING THE DISTRIBUTION:
---------------------------

The distribution might be any of a CD, a downloaded compressed "tar"
file (.tgz) or a unix "tar" tape,

0. On a unix system, it may be necessary to be the root user to
   execute the commands that follow below:
       su root

1. Select a location in which the Eclipse files, including the
   documentation, are to be placed.  Each new Eclipse distribution is
   organized under a new directory name reflecting the version number,
   so if you have an existing general "eclipse" directory that
   contains previous versions, you can reuse that top level
   directory if it has enough space in it.  Otherwise, you should
   create a new directory which will contain only Eclipse files:
	mkdir [directory name]

   You will need approximately 75 megabytes in the selected directory
   for the full distribution (all platforms, all documentation).  You
   can find out how much space is available in a directory with: 
        df [directory name]  
   (On some operating systems, use df -k [directory name].)

2. Copy the files.  Choose the method below appropriate to how you
   received the distribution.  In all cases, a new subdirectory under
   [directory name] will be created, with a name like
   eclipseXXX, where XXX reflects the current version number.

   A. CD DISTRIBUTION:

      N.B.: If you wish, you can run eclipse and/or examine the
      documentation directly from the CD, without copying it first to
      your hard disk.  In this case, references in the documentation
      to [directory name] refer to the cd mount point
      (eg. /cdrom/elwood). 

        CD Format:

        The CD simultaneously complies with several standards, and
        should be readable by several different operating systems.
        However, the most primitive standard, ISO 9660 without the
        Unix filename extensions, keeps a table of contents which
        mangles the filenames on the CD.  If you can only read this
        format, the filenames will not match those in the
        documentation, but instead have only capital letters, contain
        a semicolon, and end in a number (except for directories,
        which do not end in a number).

        In addition to the versioned directory containing the Eclipse
        distribution (eg. eclipse-1.0.1), the CD contains a tar file
        at top level on the CD that contains a second copy of
        everything else on the CD.  In "normal" long format, this file
        ends with the extension .tgz.  

        If your system is not able to read the long filenames on the
        CD, then you can use this tar file instead.  Follow the
        directions, below, for "DOWNLOADED FILE".
      
      To Copy the files to your hard disk:

      Assuming the cd is mounted on a directory on the local machine: 

        cd [directory on which cd is mounted]
        cd [eclipse version]

      (Note that this does not mean the directory must be physically
      installed on the local machine, but that it must be visible as a
      local file, using mount for example.)

      [eclipse version] is the versioned directory name appearing at
      top level on the CD (i.e. in [directory on which cd is
      mounted]).  For example, eclipse-1.0.1.  

      The files can be copied using one of the following two commands:

        find . -depth -print | cpio -pd [directory name]
      or	
        tar cf - .  | (cd [directory name] ; tar xf -)
  

      If the CD reader cannot be mounted on the local machine, you may
      be able to use the following commands from the machine on which
      the CD reader is installed:

        cd [directory on which cd is mounted]
        tar cf - .  | rsh [file host] "cd [directory name] ; tar xfB -"

      [file host] is the name of the machine on which the files should
      be installed, and on which the directory [directory name] exists.
      
   B. DOWNLOADED FILE:

      The downloaded file, which we will call [file name.tgz], should
      be in the general (i.e. non-versioned) eclipse directory
      [directory name]. 

      Uncompress the file and unload the resulting tarfile:
        cd [directory name]
        zcat [file name.tgz] | tar xvf -

   If you do not have the zcat program, you can obtain a free copy
   from the Free Software Foundation at ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu
   or a mirror such as http://www.delorie.com/gnu/.  Note that Gnu
   zcat must be used (sometimes called gzcat), not other
   implementations of "uncompress".

   C. TAPE DISTRIBUTION:

      Unload the tape:
	cd [directory name]
	tar xvf [tape device name]

   [tape device name] is the name of the tape device for your machine,
   eg. /dev/rst0

   If your tape reader is located on a different machine than the one
   you are using, you will have to contact your system administrator
   to find out how to untar the tape. 

3. On a unix system, you may wish to change the owner or permissions
   on the files:
        cd [directory name]
        chown -R [your user name] .

4. The README file indicates how to read the documentation.

5. Installation is described in the documentation.
