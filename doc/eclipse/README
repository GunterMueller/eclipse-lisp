Eclipse Common Lisp is a commercial ANSI Common Lisp, a Lisp-to-C
translator, and a Lisp library for C programmers.  It is copyright
1997, 1998 by Elwood Corporation.  Information may be obtained at 
  http://www.elwood.com/eclipse-info

These notes go along with the current product distribution.


UNPACKING THE DISTRIBUTION:
---------------------------

The file doc/eclipse/UNPACKING (mirrored at
http://www.elwood.com/eclipse/UNPACKING) describes how to copy the
software and documentation from the distribution media.


DOCUMENTATION:
--------------

The Eclipse documentation is provided as HTML files which may be
viewed using any WWW browser.  The files are in doc/eclipse/
and the initial page is doc/eclipse/index.htm

Also included is a mirror of the Association of Lisp Users web-site,
including the ANSI specification (HyperSpec) and MetaObject Protocol.
These are in doc/alu/index.htm

To read the documentation, instruct your WWW browser to "open file" or
"read file" and select the file
    doc/eclipse/eclipse.htm.
Alternatively, you can use the "open location" or "goto location"
command and specify a URL of 
    file:[path]/doc/eclipse/eclipse.htm
where [path] is the versioned subdirectory in which the distribution
was placed.   

For example, when viewing documentation on a CDROM, the URL might be
something like:
    file:/cdrom/cdrom0/eclipse-1.0.1/doc/eclipse/eclipse.htm

When the versioned distribution is copied to a general directory named
/usr/eclipse, the URL might be something like:
    file:/usr/eclipse/eclipse-1.0.1/doc/eclipse/eclipse.htm
