<h3>Features</h3>

<ul>

<p><li> Ported to Microsoft <b>Windows</b>.  (Platform SDK, win32)

<p><li>Source and library features:
<ul>
<p><li>The Eclipse C-callable library is now split into <a
href="gloss.htm#runtime"><i>runtime</i> (<i>static</i>)</a> and <a
href="gloss.htm#development"><i>development</i> (<i>dynamic</i>)</a>
parts.  The memory managment library (formerly <code>libgc</code>) is now
incorporated within the runtime library. See <a
href="lib.htm">"Eclipse Libraries"</a>.

<p><li>Calls to the C function <code>clListSTAR()</code> (and calls to
the Lisp function <b>list*</b> that are compiled to C), can now exceed
<b>call-arguments-limit</b> (provided your C compiler allows it).

<p><li>Calls to the C function <code>clFuncall()</code> (and calls to
the Lisp function <b>funcall</b> that are compiled to C) no longer
cons.

</ul>

<p><li>Pretty-printing has been reimplemented to be more efficient,
maintainable, robust, and so that it participates properly as a CLOS
stream.

<p><li>Pathname features:
<ul>
<p><li>Pathname internals have been reimplemented to be more
maintainable, robust, and to support Windows pathnames.

<p><li>Namestrings for physical pathnames can now be parsed into name,
type, and version even if the name part contains dots.

<p><li>Shell quoting is no longer supported in pathname namestrings.
</ul>

<p><li>New macros are available for defining hygienic macros: <a
href="rebinding.htm"><b>rebinding</b></a> and <a
href="unique.htm"><b>with-unique-names</b></a>.

</ul>

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

<ul>
<p>
<li>Objects of class <b>structure-class</b> can now be cleanly used as
literal in a file being processed by <b>compile-file</b> (and indeed,
any class, not just those of metaclass <b>standard-class</b>).
Previously, the system uniformly tried to create a
<b>standard-class</b> at initialization time.  Note that when a known
class is referenced as a type in a <b>typep</b>, <b>typecase</b>, or
<b>etypecase</b> operation which has been compiled to C, the generated
C code may reference the class as a compile-file literal.  The
work-around in previous releases is to evaluate the following in the
ECLIPSE package before calling <b>compile-file</b>:
<pre>
  (defmethod make-load-form ((object class) &optional environment)
    `(ensure-class ',(proper-name object t environment)
                   :metaclass ',(class-name (class-of object)))) 
</pre> 


<P>
<li> All known <b>*Print-circle*</b> and <b>pretty-printing</b> bugs
have been fixed.

<p><li><b>Listen</b> now returns <code>NIL</code> rather than getting
an error when no input is available.

<p><li>Equal and equalp hashing of pathnames does not depend on the
ability to create a readable namestring.

<p><li><b>Delete-file</b>, <b>directory</b>,
<b>ensure-directories-exist</b>, <b>file-owner</b>,
<b>file-write-date</b>, <b>open</b>, <b>probe-file</b>,
<b>rename-file</b>, <b>truename</b> now signal an error of type
<b>file-error</b> when an internal operating system request fails.

<p><li><b>User-homedir-pathname</b> returns null name, type and
version rather than :unspecific, and defaults to the current working
directory when the operating system fails to designate a home
directory.

</ul>
