<h2>What's New for Eclipse Common Lisp Release 1.0.1</h2>

<h4>November 24, 1997</h4>

<li> <a href="new-1.0.htm">1.0</a> (SunOS 4.1, Berkeley Unix)
</ul>

<h3>Features</h3>

<ul>
<li> Ported to <b>Sun Sparc/Solaris 2.6</b> (First Unix System V Eclipse platform.)
<li> The <a href="exit.htm"><b>exit restart</b></a> now prompts for
confirmation before exiting, when invoked interactively.
<li> The C function corresponding to the generated code for methods
now has a C identifier that reflects the extended function name.
<li> <b>Load/compile-file</b> have a <b>retry</b> restart.
<li> <b>Load</b> returns truename when successful.
<li> <b>Write</b> traps errors during printing (unless <b>*print-readable*</b> is
true). 
<li> Macroexpansion of <b>setf</b> does not generate <b>setq</b>
subforms when variable refers to a symbol-macro which has a
setf-expander that uses multiple 
store values.  The previous behavior was correct, because the <b>setq</b>
special form properly expands symbol-macros, but this version makes it
easier for user-written code-walkers to handle expanded code.
</ul>

<h3>Performance improvements</h3>

 <ul>
 <li> <a name="ignore-flet"><b>Elimination of unused local
functions</b></a>.  In code compiled to C, local functions such as
those defined by <b>flet/labels</b> do not cause a closure to be
created when the block of code corresponding to the <b>flet/labels</b>
is evaluated and either the function is declared <b>ignored</b>, or is not
actually used and declared <b>ignorable</b>.  The
generated C code does not contains a C function corresponding to such unused
lexical functions.  It is desirable to eliminate such definitions and
closure creations, particularly in CLOS code, where
<b>call-next-method</b> and <b>next-method-p</b> are defined for each
method using an <b>ignorable flet</b>.
<li>Compiler-macros defined for: <b>member</b> (oftent introduced in case,
etc.), arithmetic, and various internal type and clos functions. 
<li> Specialized string and vector methods for <b>find</b>,
<b>position</b>, <b>count</b>, and <b>subseq</b>.
<li> Slot name operations use <b>eq</b> rather than <b>eql</b>, and
finding items in known proper lists within MOP avoids typecasing.
<li> Functions created by <b>formatter</b> check at compile time to see if they
can avoid having to check at run time for a pretty printing stream.
 </ul>

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

 <ul>
 <li> <b>Restarts that simply return</b> to their caller, as opposed to
transfering control through a non-local exit, are now available
after they are used once.  In particular the Lisp top-level provides a
<a href="help.htm"><b>help restart</b></a> in the read-eval-print loop
that can now be used multiple times.

<li> <b>*Features* not bound by Load and Compile-File</b>.  The functions
<b>load</b> and <b>compile-file</b> no longer bind the special variable
<b>*features*</b> to the values they had before being called.  The ANSI
specification does not say that implementations are permitted to do
this, so programmers might reasonably expect the implementation to not
do this.

<li>Loading the <a name="init"><b>init files</b></a>, as described in the <a
href="top.htm">Lisp Top-Level</a> documentation, now works.  

<li>If one of the "variables" in a <b>psetq</b> form is actually a
symbol-macro form that has a setf expansion with multiple store forms
(very unusual), all multiple values are retained (not just the first).

 </ul>
