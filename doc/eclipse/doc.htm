<H2>Eclipse Introduction: Organization of the Documentation</H2>
<HR>

The <a href="intro.htm">&quot;Introductory Material&quot;</a> 
includes:

<UL>
<LI> This and other information about the documentation itself, and
about Eclipse in general.

<li> References to <a href="cl.htm">information on Common Lisp</a>,
including standard references.  The home page of the Association of
Lisp Users (ALU) contains such references and other information.  A
mirror of the ALU web-site is included with this distribution of
Eclipse.

<LI> <a href="legal.htm">License, copyright and conformance
statements</a>.

<LI> <a href="install.htm">Installation instructions</a>.

<li> <a href="release.htm">Release notes</a> about the current version.

</ul>

<p> A glossary of terms used by the Eclipse documentation which do
not appear in <a href="gloss.htm#ansi"><i>the standard</i></a> are
included in the <a href="gloss.htm">&quot;Eclipse-Specific Glossary&quot;</a>.


<P>
The remaining Eclipse documentation is divided into three groups:

<OL>
<P>
<LI> Documentation of Eclipse-specific aspects of Common Lisp.  This
is of interest to all users of Eclipse, and includes:

 <UL> <LI> <a href="lisp.htm">Aspects of Common Lisp</a> which <a
href="gloss.htm#ansi"><i>the standard</i></a> specifies as
 being defined by the <a href="defined.htm">implementation</a>.  

 <LI> Documentation of permitted <a href="extensions.htm">extensions</a>
 to Common Lisp.   

 <LI> Behavior of the <a href="top.htm">Lisp top-level</a> provided by
 the <a href="gloss.htm#eclipse"><CODE>eclipse</CODE> (1)</a> program,
 such as the reading of <a href="init.htm">initialization files</a>.

 <LI> A <a href="dict.htm">dictionary</a> of Eclipse-defined
 functions, variables and other Lisp utilities.  </UL>

<P>
<LI> <a href="c.htm">C-specific information</a>, such as:
 <UL>
 <LI> The <a href="impl.htm">representation of Lisp data</a> as C
 data.
 <LI> The argument passing convention used by functions in the
 library.
 <LI> The <a href="names.htm">naming convention</a> by which Lisp
  symbols are converted to C
  identifiers. 
 <LI> <a href="system.htm">Initializing Lisp data</a> in C
  applications.
 </UL>
This section also includes some brief material for C programmers who
are not familiar with Common Lisp.

<P>
<LI> The creation of separate, <a href="applic.htm">stand-alone
applications</a> which do not need the <a
href="gloss.htm#eclipse"><CODE>eclipse</CODE> (1)</a> program
to run.  This combines elements from both the other sections.
 <UL>
 <LI> It might be used by Lisp programmers in creating a new,
 customized Lisp top-level, perhaps incorporating some user defined C
 functions.
 
 <LI> It might be used by C programmers in incorporating their C or
 Lisp code into some other, largely C, application.
 </UL>

This includes the additional options to <a
href="compile.htm"><b>compile-file</b></a> that support the generation
of C source files from Lisp source.

</OL>

This organization follows the product organization described in <A
HREF="org.htm">&quot;Organization of Eclipse&quot;</a>.
