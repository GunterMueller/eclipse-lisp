<H2>Eclipse Introduction: Platform Specific Issues</H2>
<hr>

<h3><a name="unix">UNIX</a></h3>

<ul>
<li><p> Except as noted, C applications linked with Eclipse on Unix
systems should also link with the operating system's <code>ld</code> library.
</ul>

<h4> <a name="sun">Solaris</a></h4>
Eclipse has been compiled and tested using Solaris 2.6.

<ul>
<li> See <a href="chars.c"><code>chars.c</code></a> for information
about using the Eclipse libraries or the Eclipse executable on earlier
Solaris releases.
</ul>

<h4> <a name="hp">HP-UX</a></h4>
Eclipse has been compiled and tested using HP-UX 9.05.

<ul>
<li>C applications linked with Eclipse should also link with the
operating system's <code>dld</code> library.  (This is the HP-UX name
for <ocde>ld</code>.)

<li>See the <a HREF="UNPACKING">&quot;doc/eclipse/UNPACKING&quot;</a>
file for information about reading the distribution CD on systems
which cannot read long file names on compact disks.
</ul>


<h4> <a name="linux">Linux</a></h4>
Eclipse has been compiled and tested using Redhat Linux 4.0.

<hr>
<h3><a name="windows">WINDOWS</a></h3>

<ul>

<p>
<li> The Microsoft Windows operating system utility for obtaining
elapsed CPU run time overflows after just under 50 days of continuous
computer operation.  A computer running Windows for this long without
rebooting will report eroneous CPU run times.  Thus,
<b>get-internal-run-time</b> will not return monotonically increasing
values when the values being compared straddle such an overflow.
Comparisons between two such <b>get-internal-run-time</b> results are
not valid.

<p><li> The Eclipse-specfic function <a
href="machine-id.htm"><b>machine-id</b></a> returns <code>NIL</code>.

</ul>

<h4> <a name="nt">NT</a></h4>
Eclipse has been compiled and tested using Windows-NT 4.0.

<h4> <a name="nt">Windows</a></h4>
Eclipse has been tested using Windows-95.

<ul>
<li>Eclipse uses the Microsoft Windows Platform SDK function
<code>WaitForSingleObject()</code> to implement <b>listen</b> and
<b>read-char-no-hang</b>.  <code>WaitForSingleObject()</code> may not
be reliable on Windows-95 -- occasionally indicating that input is
available when, in fact, it is not.

<p>Eclipse itself uses these Lisp functions only when using <a
href="defined.htm#dribble"><b>dribble</b></a>, or when the operating
system supplied standard <em>output</em> has been redirected to a
non-interactive stream before calling <a
href="topf.htm"><b>clLispTopLevel</b></a>.  Under these circumstances,
the system may sometimes appear to hang when entering expressions to
the <a href="rep.htm">read-eval-print loop</a>.  A second #\return
character entered at the keyboard will clear the problem and allow the
system to accept the user input.

<p>Windows-NT does not appear to suffer from this problem.

</ul>
