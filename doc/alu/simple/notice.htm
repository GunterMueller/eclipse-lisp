This first version of the website supports only the <b>tables</b>
format.  <a href="../admin/work.htm">Volunteers are needed</a> to <a
href="../admin/dynamic.htm">make the other formats work</a>.

<p>
It is intended that when complete, the contents of this website will
be available in three <b>formats</b>, each with <b>identical
content</b>.  Users will then bookmark <b>one</b> of the three
contents pages, and see the material in a format that suits their
personal taste and their browsers capabilities.

<p>
The material that is now presented in the <a
href="../table/contents.htm">tables format</a> is believed to be complete
and stable.

<p>
By <a href="contents.htm">clicking here</a>, you can see a
mock-up of what the simple (i.e. non-tables) format will look like.
