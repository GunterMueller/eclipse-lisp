<H4>Introduction</H4>
<BR>
This paper reports on the successful application of dynamic object technology
in rapidly putting a large factory database onto the web.  MIT's Common
Lisp web server software, CL-HTTP [Mallery 1994], was used to convert a
standalone Lisp application into a nearly instant web server.  Besides the
CL-HTTP software itself, the conversion required a total of about 100 lines
of new code, including one new class, two new explicitly exported URLs,
and the modification of 5 existing methods and functions. The conversion
did not require either recompiling or rebuilding the existing application.
 In effect, thanks to dynamic object technology, the conversion from
single-user
application to web server amounted to applying a patch.<BR>
<BR>
The web application is part of an ongoing project to develop automated tools
for scheduling wafer fabs (factories in which semiconductor wafers are
fabricated)
in Motorola's Semiconductor Products Sector.  The project is grounded in
the belief that manufacturing managers and associates  need an explicit,
accurate, detailed, and timely model of the factory and its past, present,
and future behavior.  When completed, the resulting tool set will have six
major components: fab model, fab model extraction software, fab browser,
historical data browser, scheduling system, and execution system.<BR>
<H4>The Fab Browser</H4>
<BR>
The Fab Browser is a relatively mature application.  Building on [Davies
91], the Fab Browser is a textual outline browser, implemented in the style
of Dired within MCL's Fred version of Emacs.  In the browser, an object
is displayed as lines of text, each representing a component or attribute
of the project.  Some of the text lines represent other objects, which may
in turn be expanded into multiline displays. Though very general, the Fab
Browser has been highly customized for displaying wafer fab data, with
specialized
views of the fab model, scheduling data, and historical data.  Using expansion
methods that optionally depend on the customer for the display,  the Fab
Browser is further customized to the needs of each fab, and even to the
needs of individuals within the fab, <BR>
<BR>
The basic implementation of the Fab Browser is straightforward.  The top
level is a function which initializes the Fred buffer with lines of text
representing major structural components of the wafer fab and operational
data.  Each line is inserted by a function called <TT>insert-line</TT>,
which inserts a line of text in the buffer and associates an object with
the line of text.  When such a line is double-clicked, the Fab Browser invokes
the <TT>expand </TT>method for the object associated with the line.  Each
object class in the Orchestra factory representation has an <TT>expand</TT>
method, which inserts multiple lines describing the object into the buffer.
 Hence, information is displayed in the Fab Browser by repeated handoffs
between the <TT>expand</TT> methods for objects and the <TT>insert-line</TT>
function.<BR>
<BR>
Besides the basic expand capability, the Fab Browser offers other ways of
extracting information about a selected object, mechanisms for contracting
previous expansions, and a mechanisms for creating a hardcopy report of
data that has been expanded.  The Fab Browser also offers mechanisms for
text filtering of potentially large expansions.<BR>
<BR>
Users find the Fab Browser powerful and easy to use.  They like being able
to get a high-level summary of fab data and then expand the summary to
arbitrary
levels of detail using only the mouse.  They like the speed of the browser:
expansions happen very quickly because tens of megabytes of manufacturing
data are cached, in a network of CLOS objects, within the browser
application.<BR>
<BR>
Because of the large amount of data cached within it, the browser application
runs in 70 to 100+ megabytes of memory, depending on the amount of historical
or projected data.  This was a significant roadblock to widespread use of
the browser, both because of the amount of RAM needed to run such applications
efficiently and because of problems of keeping large applications up to
date on multiple desktops, some connected by modem lines. The situation
demanded a client-server solution, but resources were not available to create
either a customized server or a customized client.<BR>
<H4>Enter the Web</H4>
<BR>
Late in 1995, we began investigating CL-HTTP as a possible means of providing
web access to Orchestra data.  For a time, because of problems with the
MCL implementation of IP/TCP networking, we could not get CL-HTTP to operate
properly in our large-address-space MCL applications.  Once John Mallery
reimplemented MCL's MacTCP interface in March 1996, we were able to make
progress on converting Orchestra to the web.  The goals for the web
implementation
were to (1) provide access to the same data, (2) preserve the look and feel,
which had already demonstrated its effectiveness, (3) preserve performance,
and (4) eliminate dependence on a heavyweight, expensive user platform in
favor of lightweight, inexpensive client software.<BR>
<BR>
The result: once the MacTCP problems were resolved, we ported the outline
browser to CL-HTTP in about one person-week.  The goals for the web
implementation
were achieved for the most part.  Fab data is now accessible through a web
browser  to anyone in the wafer fab with a computer, whether Mac, PC, or
Unix.  The look and feel of the web interface are somewhat different from
the original single-user version.   The main difference is due to the
inability
to do in-place outline expansion.  The single-user application uses multiple
levels of nested indentation (like the twist-down behavior of the Mac Finder
under System 7).  The web version brings up a new window for each expansion
(like the Finder under System 6).  Per character displayed, the web interface
is slower than the single-user interface, but feels like typical web access.
 Both network delay and CL-HTTP overhead appear to be factors.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks to CL-HTTP, the implementation was almost a trivial undertaking,
once we understood what we needed to do.  After loading the CL-HTTP software
into the application, the port from single-user to server required about
100 lines of new code, with significant changes to only five functions in
the original implementation.  As described, the original was implemented
as recursive hand-offs between the <TT>expand</TT> methods, which know how
to format the complete display of an object, and the <TT>insert-line</TT>
function, which formats each line of the expansion.  The main changes were
to put the CL-HTTP server in charge of issuing the expand methods, through
an appropriate &quot;search URL,&quot; and to force <TT>insert-line</TT>
to emit HTML to the appropriate stream when serving the web.  The HTML sent
by <TT>insert-line</TT> includes an URL which can be used to expand the
object associated with the line.<BR>
<BR>
To serve multiple users, the server generates, for each user, an instance
of a new class, a connection object.  The connection object maintains an
index of the URLs to which the user has been given access and to the objects
referenced by the URLs.  URLs encode both the connection ID and an integer
index to Lisp objects that have been made visible to the user by
<TT>insert-line</TT>.<BR>
<BR>
Although our web implementation of the Fab Browser is still in prototype
form, it promises the client/server solution that we long needed.  CL-HTTP
and MCL have provided a strong foundation for rapid progress.<BR>
<BR>
First, CL-HTTP provides - in our usual Common Lisp environment - the
advantages
of an embedded web server: (1) direct access to data, without the need for
an intervening CGI-style interface, (2) access to existing Lisp software,
including format, (3) easy compatibility between the single-user, Fred-based
interface and the web interface, and (4) higher performance than a more
loosely coupled solution.<BR>
<BR>
Second, MCL (and Common Lisp in general) provides the advantages of dynamic
object technology.  Because of this, we were able to create a web server
by patching the single-user application.  We did not need to recompile or
even rebuild the original application.  We simply loaded the CL-HTTP software
and the few needed changes into the existing application - and we were on
the web.  Dynamic object technology provided the most tangible benefit in
modifying the properties of the <TT>expand</TT> methods to output to the
web.  To change all of the <TT>expand</TT> methods (for dozens of different
classes), we needed only to change the default <TT>:before</TT>,
<TT>:after</TT>,
and   <TT>:around</TT> methods for expand.<BR>
<BR>
Our near-term plans include capturing additional aspects of the Fab Browser,
such as filtering of output through text-matching and the transmission of
graphical output (e.g., column and bar charts) across the web.  The next
step will be to recapture client-mediated, in-place, indented expansion,
probably with Java.<BR>
<H4>Conclusion</H4>
<BR>
Dynamic object technology wins again, with CL-HTTP as the vehicle.  CL-HTTP,
layered on top of an existing object-oriented Lisp application, has made
it possible - even easy - to rapidly retarget a valuable data browsing
application
to the web.<BR>
