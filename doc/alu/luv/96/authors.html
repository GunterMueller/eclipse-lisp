<A HREF="mailto:JCMa@ai.mit.edu"><img src="../../img/mail.gif" align=left> John C. Mallery</A>
</a>
is a research scientist at the Artificial Intelligence
Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His research interests
center around new ways to model international interactions and new
ways to incorporate advanced computational methods into interactive
political communication. He has developed computer systems that
construct natural language models from narrative text, learn if-then
rules from complexly-structured event data, and conduct automatic
opinion surveys over global computer networks. An electronic
publications system, which he developed for use during the 1992
presidential campaign, currently serves as the primary distribution
hub for press releases by the U.S. White House. His current research
explores intelligent information access, wide-area collaboration,
knowledge-based organizations, and global knowledge webs.
