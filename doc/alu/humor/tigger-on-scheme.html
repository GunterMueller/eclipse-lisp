	The wonderful thing about Scheme is:		
	Scheme is a wonderful thing.			
	Complex procedural ideas			
	Are expressed via simple strings.		
	Its clear semantics, and lack of pedantics,	
	Help make programs run, run, RUN!		
	But the most wonderful thing about Scheme is:	
	Programming in it is fun,			
	Programming in it is FUN!
