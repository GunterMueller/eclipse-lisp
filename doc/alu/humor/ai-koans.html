<H4>AI Koans: (by Danny)</H4>

  A novice was trying to fix a broken lisp machine by turning the
power off and on.  Knight, seeing what the student was doing spoke
sternly- "You can not fix a machine by just power-cycling it with no
understanding of what is going wrong."<P>
  Knight turned the machine off and on.<P>
  The machine worked.<P>

One day a student came to Moon and said, "I understand how to make a
better garbage collector.  We must keep a reference count of the
pointers to each cons." Moon patiently told the student the following

  In the days when Sussman was a novice Minsky once came to him as he
sat hacking at the PDP-6.  "What are you doing?", asked Minsky.<BR>
  "I am training a randomly wired neural net to play Tic-Tac-Toe."<BR>
  "Why is the net wired randomly?", asked Minsky.<BR>
  "I do not want it to have any preconceptions of how to play"<BR>
  Minsky shut his eyes,<BR>
  "Why do you close your eyes?", Sussman asked his teacher.<BR>
  "So that the room will be empty."<BR>
  At that momment, Sussman was enlightened.<P>

A student, in hopes of understanding the Lambda-nature, came to
Greenblatt.  As they spoke a Multics system hacker walked by.  "Is it
true", asked the student, "that PL-1 has many of the same data types as
Lisp".  Almost before the student had finshed his question, Greenblatt
shouted, "FOO!", and hit the student with a stick.<P>

A disciple of another sect once came to Drescher as he was eating his
morning meal.  "I would like to give you this personality test", said
the outsider,"because I want you to be happy." Drescher took the paper
that was offered him and put it into the toaster- "I wish the toaster to
be happy too".<P>

A cocky novice once said to Stallman: "I can guess why the editor is
called Emacs, but why is the justifier called Bolio?". Stallman replied
forcefully, "Names are but names, `Emac & Bolio's` is the name of a 
confectionary shop in Boston-town. Neither of these men had anything to do
with the software."<P>
His question answered, yet unanswered, the novice turned to go, but
Stallman called to him, "Neither Emac or Bolio had anything to do with
the ice cream shop, either."<P>

Yes, you guested it, an ice cream koan.<P>
