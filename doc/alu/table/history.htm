Lisp was invented by <A
HREF="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/home.html">John McCarthy</A>
in the late 1950's as a formalism for reasoning about the use of
recursion equations as a model for computation.  Of computer languages
still in widespread use today, only FORTRAN is older.  

<P> Lisp has evolved with the field of Computer Science, always
putting the best ideas from the field into practical use.  In 1994,
Common Lisp became the first <A HREF="references.htm#ansi">ANSI standard</A>
to incorporate <A HREF="objects.htm">object
oriented programming</A>.

<P>
The early development of Lisp is described by McCarthy in <A
href="papers.htm#mccarthy">"History of Lisp"</a>, 1978.

<P>
Two of the major developers of the language since then, <A
HREF="bibliography.htm#gabriel"> Richard Gabriel</A> and <A
HREF="bibliography.htm#steele">Guy Steele</A>, presented "The Evolution of
Lisp" <A href="ftp://ftp.cs.umbc.edu/pub/Memoization/Misc/Evolution-of-Lisp.ps.Z">
<IMG ALIGN=TOP SRC="../img/ftp.xbm"></A> at the 1993
ACM History of Programming Languages conference. 

<P>
Kent Pitman and Brad Miller have compiled <A
HREF="Lisp-History.html">a brief
on-line version</A> of the history of Lisp from ANSI documents.

<P>
<A
HREF="http://www8.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/IMMD8/staff/Stoyan/stoyan.html">Herbert
Stoyan</A> began his study of the history of Lisp in the early 1970s,
while in East Germany.  He carried out this study by writing letters
to everyone whose name he could find in the documents as well as by
getting every book and report he could.  In 1979 he applied to
emigrate from East Germany, was arrested, spent six months in prison
and then was permitted to emigrate to West Germany.  When he got out
of East Germany, he visited M.I.T. and examined every document he
could find relevant to the history of Lisp and also interviewed
everyone he could.  He is now Professor of Computer Science at the
University of Erlangen-Nuremberg in Erlangen, Germany, where his group
works on AI.  His history of Lisp is also <A

on-line</A>.

<DT>3Lisp
 <DD>A reflective Lisp. The Lisp system was based on an infinite tower
 of Lisp interpreters. 

<DT> <A HREF="related-languages.htm#autocad">AutoLisp</a> (Autocad)

<DT> <A NAME="common">Common Lisp</A>
 <DD>The result of a <A HREF="references.htm#ansi">standardization
 effort</A>, which began in the early 1980s.  This is a highly
 portable, industrial strength Lisp with a variety of <A
 HREF="systems.htm">implementations</A> and a wealth of <A

<DT> <A HREF="related-languages.htm#eulisp">EuLisp</a>

<DT>Flavors
 <DD> The object oriented programming facility of <a
 href="#zetalisp"">Zetalisp</a>.  Major differences from the <a
 href="glossary.htm#clos">Common Lisp Object System</a> include message
 passing rather than generic functions (more like <a
 href="related-languages.htm#smalltalk">Smalltalk</a>) and a different inheritence
 ordering protocol.

<DT><a name="franz">Franz Lisp</a>
 <DD> This was a Lisp for conventional architectures, and the product
 that launched <a href="systems.htm#franz">Franz, Inc</a>.

<DT> <A HREF="related-languages.htm#interleaf">Interleaf</a>

<DT>InterLisp
 <DD>This dialect has been developed at Xerox and was the base for
 some early workstations. These systems had a nice comfortable user
 environment using mouse and windows. The language lives on in
 Medley. Was also the base for NoteCards, an early hypertext system. 

<DT> <A HREF="related-languages.htm#islisp">ISLisp</a>

<DT> Lisp 1.5
 <DD> For reference see the book &quot;LISP 1.5 Programmer's Manual, MIT Press&quot;

<DT><a name="loops">LOOPS</a>
 <DD> The Lisp Object-Oriented Programming System.  A close precursor
 to the Common Lisp Object System (<a
href="glossary.htm#clos">CLOS</a>).  A fairly portable version
 is called <a href="tools.htm#clos">PCL</a>.

<DT> <A NAME="maclisp">MacLisp</A>
 <DD>MacLisp was developed at MIT and had much influence on the design
 of Common Lisp.  In particular, <a href="zetalisp">ZetaLisp</a> and
<a href="related-languages.htm#scheme">Scheme</a> were descendent from it. Paper:
 <A HREF="http://www.best.com/~thvv/lcp.htm">&quot;The Multics Maclisp
 Compiler -- the &gt; Basic Hackery, a Tutorial&quot;</A>. 
<P>
<DD> The MAC in Maclisp had nothing to do with the Apple Macintosh,
 which did not come onto the computer scene until later.  Rather,
 it referred to Project MAC, a research project at MIT which later 
 became known as the Laboratory for Computer Science.  The acronym
 MAC stood for no particular thing, but various meanings were
 attached, such as: "Men and Computers", "Minds and Cognition",
 "Machine-Aided Cognition", etc.  (The symbolic algebra program
 Macsyma was originally written at Project MAC in Maclisp, hence
 the MAC in its name.)

 Algebra application). See: <A
