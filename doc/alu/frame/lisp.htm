"Lisp is a programmable programming language."

LISP is an acronym for LISt Processing.  Its development <A
HREF="history.htm">history</A> has often been associated with <A
HREF="glossary.htm#symbolic">symbolic processing</A> and with both
computer and human languages.  A <A
HREF="glossary.htm#heterogeneous">heterogeneous</A> list data type has
always been built into the language in order to efficiently deal with
arbitrary and changing models.

<P>
From this basis, a number of features have come to be expected from
all members of the Lisp family of languages:

<UL>

<li> a <a href="top-level.htm">top-level</a> in which code can be run
<LI> <A HREF="syntax.htm"> decoupled syntax from semantics</A>
<LI><A HREF="evaluation.htm"> compiled / interpreted</A>
<LI> <A HREF="environment.htm"> language / libraries / environment</A>
<LI> <A HREF="objects.htm"> object-oriented / procedural</A>
<LI> <A HREF="dynamic.htm"> dynamic / static</A>
<LI> <A HREF="types.htm"> strong / weak typing</A>
<LI> <A HREF="memory.htm"> memory mangagement</A>
<LI> <A HREF="macros.htm"> macros</A>
<LI> <A HREF="3GL.htm"> 3GL/4GL/5GL</A>

</UL>

Lisp has evolved into a <A HREF="history.htm#family">family of languages</A>.
The two major dialects in use today are <A
HREF="history.htm#common">Common Lisp</A> and <A
HREF="related-languages.htm#scheme">Scheme</A>.  This web site deals mostly with
Common Lisp.

<P>
Lisp may be <a href="combine.htm">combined with other languages</a> to
produce wide variety of <A HREF="good.htm">applications</A>.

<P> There have been a number of <A HREF="compare.htm">comparisons</A>
between Lisp and other languages.
